# excel-to-mysql

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ngudbhav/excel-to-mysql.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ngudbhav/excel-to-mysql) [![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/ngudbhav/excel-to-mysql.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/ngudbhav/excel-to-mysql)

This module converts your correctly formatted Excel spreadsheet to a specified table in specified database in MYSQL. The queries can also be written in a file (BETA).

## Excel Formats Supported

Supported Excel formats are XLS/XLSX/CSV.

## Usage

The Database must already be created in MYSQL. A table name should be provided. Please keep the column names in String format only.

## Spreadsheet Format

Please have a look at the sample Excel sheets provided to have a clear view of the File. <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=521962">Microsoft Sample Sheet (XLSX)</a>

## Installation

```sh
npm install excel-to-mysql --save
```

## Testing

```sh
git clone https://github.com/ngudbhav/excel-to-mysql.git
cd excel-to-mysql/
```

Navigate to the folder.

```sh
cd test/
nano test.js
```

Now this file needs the MYSQL credentials. Provide those credentials in String format and save by pressing the following keys.

```sh
'CTRL+X'
'Y'
'Return'
```

Get back and test the module.

```sh
cd ..
npm test
```

## Using

Note: Please correctly format the Excel sheet else this won't work.

```sh
var excelMysql = require('excel-to-mysql');
```

This module needs 3 arguments.
The first one is the object with your credentials.

Database connection can be established in 2 ways.
1. Pass in your connection object which is the return of `mysql.createConnection`. The connection accepts connection both from mysql/mysql2. The same connection will be used to read/write data.
2. Pass in your credentials in the below format. `mysql` will be used to create a connection.


```sh
var credentialsForDB = {
	host: host,
	user: MYSQL Username,
	pass: Password for the above account,
	path: path for the excel file,
	table: Table name for creation,
	db: Your Database name,
	endConnection*: true,
	connection: <Object>
};
```

* Please note that endConnection false may not terminate the process.

```sh
var credentialsForFile = {
	path: path for the excel file,
	table: Table name for creation,
	db: Your Database name
};
```

The second one is an optional argument of options with default values as follows.

```sh
var options = {
	verbose: true // logs the steps undergoing.
	autoId: false // Automatically insert id of every row, i.e., numbering every row.
	customStartEnd: false // Custom insert the row and columns rather than full excel-file.
	startRow: <required> // Valid only if customStartEnd is true. Defines the start Row of the data.
	endRow: <required> // Valid only if customStartEnd is true. Defines the end Row of the data.
	startCol: <required> // Valid only if customStartEnd is true. Defines the start Column of the data.
	endCol: <required> // Valid only if customStartEnd is true. Defines the end Column of the data.
	safeMode: false // Backup the db to the <destination> with <db>.sql as file name.
	destination: <String> // Valid only if safeMode is true. The location of db.sql file.
}
```

The third argument is the callback function which will be executed only after the completion of the whole conversion.

```sh
excelMysql.covertToMYSQL(credentials, options, callback);
excelMysql.convertToFile(credentials, options, callback);
```

convertToFile Function will write the .sql file to the current working directory with <code>db</code>.sql as the file name.
